Known Issues
------------

 - If the cloud repository is empty, `git` throws an error during initial
   workspace cloning.
 - `mvn gcloud:deploy -Dgcloud.set_default=true` seems to fail during first
   deployment because of errors with the Datastore index
 - Runners launched from the Google menu are missing the stop button and output
   will get detached

Features
--------

 - Cloud repository is initialized as Git remote on first launch, for the
   correct project ID and module ID.
 - Template can be pulled into project repository to start sample projects
 - Default runners are pre-configured for building, running, and deploying to
   App Engine.
 - Ready for Google Cloud: Google Cloud SDK, Java 8, Maven, Git, Build tools
 - Pre-installed Maven dependencies in `~/.m2` speed up `mvn gcloud:run` and
   `mvn gcloud:deploy` commands.
 - `git-credential` helper monitors `gcloud` credentials and blocks git
   commands until configured
 - Terminal output is monitored for URLs and a notification shown when local
   run or deployment is detected
 - Deep link to Developers Console through project menu

Pending
-------

 - Include Amin's Java language tooling plugins to integrate Kythe
 - Render Java package tree instead of directory/file tree
 - Update menu buttons to `[Preview] [Build] [Deploy]`
 - Add dialog for selecting from template projects
 - Fix the extra `gcloud auth login` step currently required during first
   launch. The C9 API key needs to be granted access to repo API scope.
 - Consider using `scmurl` for template repo to make it easier to clone from
   external templates
 - Integrate Google Cloud Debugger for Java debugging
 - Talk to Google about __Google Cloud Shell__ credentials, in particular
   `/google/credentials/credential_service.py`
 - Integrate `git commit; git push` into deployment flow
