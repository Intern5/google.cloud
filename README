Limitations
-----------

 - Cloud9 extensions are fixed to the version they had when the workspaces was
   created. They are not updated automatically. To get never versions, delete
   your workspace and create a new one.

 - This release on Cloud9 only supports a few well-known project layouts. To
   run a project it has to be: Java Web Application with JSP, Servlets;
   Maven; Java App Engine Managed VM. The system detects `pom.xml`, `web.xml`
   and other files for validation.

Features
--------

 - Cloud repository is initialized as Git remote on first launch, for the
   correct project ID and module ID.
 - Template can be pulled into project repository to start sample projects
 - Default runners are pre-configured for building, running, and deploying to
   App Engine.
 - Ready for Google Cloud: Google Cloud SDK, Java 8, Maven, Git, Build tools
 - Pre-installed Maven dependencies in `~/.m2` speed up `mvn gcloud:run` and
   `mvn gcloud:deploy` commands.
 - `git-credential` helper monitors `gcloud` credentials and blocks git
   commands until configured
 - Terminal output is monitored for URLs and a notification shown when local
   run or deployment is detected
 - Deep link to Developers Console through project menu

Known Issues
------------

 - If the cloud repository is empty, `git` throws an error during initial
   workspace cloning. This error can be ignored.
 - The output window for __deploy__ has no stop button and its output can
   become detached.
 - Attempting to deploy a new project can lead to an error if the project is
   not connected to a Billing Account. This error message is combined with
   others and hard to find. Cloud9 should run a pre-check an warn the user if
   the current project is not configured for Billing.

Pending
-------

 - Extend terminal monitor to reload live preview when it sees certain messages
 - Include Amin's Java language tooling plugins to integrate Kythe
 - Render Java package tree instead of directory/file tree
 - Consider using `scmurl` for template repo to make it easier to clone from
   external templates
 - Integrate Google Cloud Debugger for Java debugging
 - Integrate `git commit; git push` into deployment flow
 - Add `hello-world` and `websocket-chat` demo projects
